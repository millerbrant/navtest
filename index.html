<title>Brant soldiers on, activity 2</title>
<p>This project is intended to display what I've learned thus far<br>
Barring that, this project will expose how little I've learned.<br>
Either way, it'll be a riot.
</p>

<p>On second thought, this activity is actually intended to demonstrate <br>
    that I understand the basic navigation flow of these self-hosted pages <br>
    So uhh, see paragraph above about what I've learned or not.
